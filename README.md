Machine Learning Model Predicts Autism

## Overview
This project focuses on Autism Diagnostics using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to predict whether an individual is on the autism spectrum based on their responses to the AQ10 Questionnaire. The project leverages both supervised and unsupervised learning methods:
- **Supervised Learning**: A machine learning model is trained to predict a diagnosis based on the responses to the AQ10 Questionnaire.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: An exploratory approach to uncover patterns and characteristics associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

## Features
- **Interactive User Interface**: Users can take the AQ10 Questionnaire and receive a prediction of whether they might be on the autism spectrum.
- **Supervised Learning Model**: Trained on a labeled dataset to predict ASD diagnoses based on questionnaire responses.
- **Unsupervised Learning Exploration**: Utilized to identify potential patterns in autism characteristics, highlighting the complexity of ASD.
